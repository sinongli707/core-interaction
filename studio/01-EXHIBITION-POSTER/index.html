<p>  Exhibition catalog are characterized into two types. First one is a printed list of exhibits at an art exhibition and the other one is a directory of exhibitors at a trade event.</p>

<p>The catalogs nowadays usually formed in a book size, and contains colour photograph and all the displayed items in the exhibition. Also, it sometimes include relevant works which are not in display but related to the show. Besides color photograph, the catalog usually will also have short description for each item.</p>
<p>The catalog would also be in different language according to where the exhibition is held. It is interesting to me that the catalog would also facing the problem of localizing. The local translation would be something critical to the production of the catalog. Also, the publication also means something in catalog making. Nearly all the catalog are produced in paperback, and a hardback edition shows a sense of seriousness in intention. The catalog are usually designed for permanent usefulness and the hardcover edition can be usually purchased through other way then museums.</p>
