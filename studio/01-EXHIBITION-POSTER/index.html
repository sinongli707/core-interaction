        <p class="par1">We will find exhibitions in every gallery, museum we visit.  They are sometimes the reason we have for visiting. Each exhibition is an individual and has its own traits, like each person has her own personalities.There are questions and obstacles faced by designers when they are making the “business card” for each exhibition. Browsing exhibition posters online, I found information for location, the theme and the name of the exhibition are essential. Meanwhile, fitting the information into a defined theme is also crucial to the piece, not only combine information with the exhibition theme visually, but also integrate the graphic identity of the museum or the gallery it is displayed in. Designers are aim to design a poster that best reflect the idea of the exhibition, design a type treatment that communicate who the artist is and their work. Most importantly, everything on the poster must work with the graphic design for the exhibition. For me it is really hard to find the balance between these element, how to make them to complement each other.
As the technology today developed into a new stage, there are more than one way than paper media to spread the information. More and more people, especially the young, use digital media such as phone and computer to acquire latest information and news. Internet and screen became places for design to perform, so does poster. So when a poster for exhibition is being created, the viewing experience from screen must be taken into consideration. This fact elevate the problem that designer face to balance the element and fit the big theme. </p>
