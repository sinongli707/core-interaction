    <p> A museum store seems necessary nowadays for each museum. In each store we can see a lot of design product, or recreation, appropriation of the current exhibition. Printing the masterpieces on a tote bag, making the drawings into postcards or some newly designed daily object that looks very cool to the audience. However, it is interesting when thinking about the role of museum shop and designs play in visitors’ visiting experience. </p>

      <p>Kent (2010) states in his research conclusion that the museum store merchandising provide a learning space for the visitors to think outside of the exhibition and hence get a better understanding of the exhibition and the information. Which means, by setting up a store and merchandised the art work helps a museum to better convey its idea in order to achieve a better outcome when playing the role as public educator. </p>

      <p>According to Kent’s studies about museum store,  all the products are related to the exhibition, serving as a memento, later will remind the visitors about what they’ve seen in the exhibition and what they’ve learnt. After seeing this concept, the design store in the museum is more interesting to me then usual. The design store including the designed products it sell appeals more than a commercialized activity but a more psychological. What to sell in the store? How to attract the visitor? or even what will serve a better educating purpose?</p>
