    <p>The definition for curator is “one who has the care and superintendence of something; especially : one in charge of a museum, zoo, or other place of exhibit”. In short, who play an important role in museum. Not only responsible for visual concept, but also responsible for the funding and the operation of the exhibition. A lot of decision made by curator has huge impact on the trend or the finalized design decisions. </p>

    <p>Take exhibition graphic design, which was introduced in the previous post, for example, designers first come up with multiple ideas and sketches for the exhibition. Then the curator come in to design which design would be more suitable for the show, in another word, curator basically decide which design should be applied in the exhibition space. The curator has the right to do so because he or she is the one responsible for making a exhibition, and is the one that knows what design would fit to her original concept. </p>

    <p>According to Hans Ulrich Obrist, curating as profession - “It means to preserve, in the sense of safeguarding the heritage of art. It means to be the selector of new work. It means to connect to art history. And it means displaying or arranging the work.” Curator is the bridge between artwork, museum and public. Curator is the one knows his artist, his audience, and to find them, challenge them. </p>
